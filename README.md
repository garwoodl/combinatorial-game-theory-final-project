# combinatorial-game-theory-final-project
A coding project for Math 480 Combinatorial Game Theory (Spring 2024) exploring the relationship between AI and combinatorial game theory. Specifically, I will study the game Toads and Frogs and hope to implement several bots to play the game at a high level using a combination of heuristics and reinforcement learning.
